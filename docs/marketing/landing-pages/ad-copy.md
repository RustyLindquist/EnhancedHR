## Copy Rationale and Message-Match Notes

### Landing Page 1 (Features)
- Ads lead with tangible specifics (5 AI agents, SHRM/HRCI credits) to attract intent-driven searchers looking for HR learning platforms.
- Google headlines front-load "AI-Native" and "SHRM Approved" since these are the highest-signal terms for the target buyer.
- LinkedIn copy leans into the breadth of the platform to appeal to leaders evaluating tools for their teams.
- Hero headline resolves the ad promise into outcomes ("Learn Faster. Know More. Stay Certified.") while a pre-headline badge immediately reinforces ad specifics ("5 AI Agents · SHRM & HRCI Approved").

### Landing Page 2 (Challenger)
- Ads use the provocative reframe from the challenger narrative: AI is a commodity, people are the differentiator.
- Google description D1 uses the Gartner stat (47% of workers struggle to find information) as a pattern interrupt in search results.
- LinkedIn copy speaks directly to the strategic HR leader who thinks beyond tool adoption to organizational capability.

### Landing Page 3 (Original)
- Ads center the buyer's identity and the "Human Resources to Human Relevance" reframe.
- Google headlines lead with the transformation narrative to resonate emotionally with HR leaders who feel the pressure of AI disruption.
- LinkedIn copy mirrors the empathy-first tone of the landing page, validating the buyer's situation before introducing the platform.

### General Notes
- All ads include the 7-day free trial offer to reduce friction.
- SHRM and HRCI are referenced by name (not generically as "certifications") for credibility and search relevance.
- No exclamation marks or ALL CAPS used outside of brand names.
- Character counts verified for each variant.
