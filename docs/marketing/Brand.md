Organizations thrive when their people are educated, aligned, and empowered.

Our platform exists to make this happen — at scale, and at the speed of change.

## Quick refresher on Prometheus

From the classical myth:

- Prometheus is a **Titan of forethought** (his brother Epimetheus = “afterthought”). So Prometheus is connected to the idea of “thinking and planning ahead”, and being ahead of the game. We use the AI name Prometheus to imply that users of the AI on our platform are “thinking ahead’ and that it puts you “ahead of the game” in HR or leadership, which is key to maintaining personal (human) relevance in the age of AI, that human + AI puts you (and an org) ahead of doing either in isolation.
- He **creates or shapes humanity from clay** and becomes their champion. As the champion of humanity, this works well with our theme. The idea is that the power of AI augments and helps champion the contribution of humans in the org, when used correctly.
- Prometheus **steals fire from Olympus** and gives it to humanity – symbolically giving them technology, knowledge, and civilization. This too connects well, as we are providing knowledge, on how to use the fire (AI as tech). The analogy here is that Prometheus AI brings you (and your org) power (technology, insights, knowledge, and just-in-time assistance.

You basically can’t ask for a more on-the-nose mythic metaphor for “AI as fire”,  a kind of narrative support for an organizations need to augment people, not replace them. AI (as fire) can drive org performance when used right, but it can also burn an organization when used wrong (e.g. by simply replacing humans).

## Prometheus as a platform name –

### Strengths

1. **Perfect metaphor for AI-as-fire**
    
    You’re literally building a system that:
    
    - Brings the “fire” of AI to the *people side* of the org
    - Teaches them to wield it
    - Challenges the old order of work, precedent, and inertia
    
    That’s Prometheus in a nutshell.
    
2. **Forethought as a leadership virtue**
    
    The etymology (“forethought”) lines up with your core narrative: HR and leaders who anticipate and shape the future, rather than react after the fact. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3. **Human-first, not machine-first**
    
    Prometheus is a *champion of humanity* against distant, indifferent power. That maps cleanly to:
    
    > “We’re on the side of humans in an AI age; we’re democratizing the fire, not hoarding it.”
    > 
4. **Deep, durable story well**
    
    You can mine this for years:
    
    - Prometheus vs Epimetheus → proactive vs reactive orgs
    - Fire as “capability,” not “headcount reduction”
    - The need for wisdom, ethics, and guardrails around powerful tools
5. **Clean separation from company brand**
    - Company: **EnhancedHR** (value-descriptive, outcome anchored)
    - Platform: **Prometheus** (story-heavy, techy, memorable)
    - “Prometheus, by EnhancedHR” gives you what Instructure never really had with Canvas.

IMPORTANT - Prometheus, is just a feature name that we prominently and powerfully portray, but the brand name is EnhancedHR.

We want to really emphasize the idea that our platform enhances HR and a Leader by providing ____ (insert feature).
