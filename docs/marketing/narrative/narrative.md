Here is what matters today

The implementation of AI into what was already the fiercest economic battleground in history, hasn’t changed the fundamentals of what will durably differentiate you.

AI is now a commodity.

Everyone is hoping that AI is going to revolutionize their competitive advantage. But the reality is, AI is now a commodity. Everyone has it (or soon will), so the the implementation of AI will not durably differentiate you. 

AI innovation is simply moving too fast, and the implementation barriers are too low. Whatever you implement today, can be just as easily implemented by your competitors tomorrow, but with tomorrow’s technology. And when the technology is evolving on a day to day basis, tomorrow’s implementation will likely be a step up from whatever you implement today.

So you not implement AI? Of course you do, but AI integration is now table stakes, not a fundamental, long-term differentiator.

Simply put, the implementation of AI is not a long-term competitive moat.

What is then? 

Humans, just like before.

What really changed?

Velocity.

You can now simply do what you did (or could have done) before, only faster.

But when their velocity matches yours, where is your differentiation? It’s the same place it’s always been, it’s in your people.

Your people are your only path to long term strategic advantage. Why, because human talent is the scarce resource.

In short, what’s really changed is not HOW you differentiate, that has always been your people and the skills they possess.

What has changed? Velocity.

Your people now need the ability to learn,  acquire new skills, and extract insights from information at a much higher velocity.

To do that, you need a platform to not only accommodate, but accelerate the velocity at which your people can learn and acquire insights from information.

Introducing EnhancedHR, the platform that enhances human relevance for organizational advantage…

How do we do that?

# Learning Velocity

The rate at which your people learn matters more now then ever before. But the nature of learning has changed. Whereas other learning platforms prioritize old-school learning methodologies (watching courses), EnhancedHR recognizes that the real value is more than courses, it’s AI-Enabled course augmentation.

## Top-Tier Courses

Our courses are expert led. And when we say experts, we don’t just mean “anyone who has something to say”. Our experts hold multiple Ph.D.’s, have “been there and done that”, they’re truly world-class leaders with cutting-edge content tailored to the needs of today’s organizations.

## AI-Augmentation

Alongside each course are two integrated agents. 

### **The Course Assistant:**

Trained on the entirety of the course, the Course Assistant gives you conversational access to understand the course material through your distinct lens.

Ask it anything. 

Ask it to give you a summary of the key takeaways. Ask it what this means for your current objectives and initiatives. Ask it to help you craft a strategy based on this (or at least influenced by it). Ask it to reframe the content based on your industry, your organization, your culture, your role, your objectives, and your context.

While the course helps you learn, the assistant is there to help you APPLY that learning, because this is the aspect of learning that matters most. Otherwise, it’s just knowledge acquisition that never hits what actually matters… role performance.

### The Course Tutor

The Course Tutor, also trained on the entirety of the course, takes learning to a whole new level. As opposed to static content consumption, the course tutor engages you in socratic dialog. It asks you critical questions, and learns about your unique situation.

Armed with all of that, the course tutor then creates an entirely individualized learning experience. It teaches you the course content in a way that is informed by the insights that you provide it. This augmented engagement deepens your ability to truly understand the information, and in a way that is totally tailored to you, your org, and all the other context that a static course cannot contain.

# Knowledge Transfer

In addition to our growing inventory of expert-created content, your organization (and the teams within it), likely already have a host of content you need your people to learn. We enable the transfer of this critical, institutional knowledge within the same, AI-enhanced learning environment.

## Organizational Courses

Use our intuitive course builder, the very builder our experts use, to build your own courses. Build a course for onboarding new hires. Build a course on culture. Build a course on the market, or your product or industry. The sky is the limit.

And of course every single course you make is enhanced by the same two specialized AI agents. Each agent is then trained on your course the moment you publish it.

Now your team has access to not only the static learning experience and the knowledge you imbue into your course, but they have conversational access to better understand what it means and how it applies to them specifically. And they can engage the tutor for a much more personalized path to understanding.

## Organizational Collections

And of course, not everything can be so easily imbued into a complete course experience. And not everything needs to be.

So our platform allows you to create custom content collections. Load it up with your documents, your policies, your handbook, or even videos you’ve created.

Every collection you create is augmented by a separate, dedicated and specially trained AI Agent.

### The Collection Assistant

Everything you add to a collection is individually parsed and added to a vector database which the Collection Assistant is trained on. This means you can load it up with all of your organizational context, and your team now has conversational access to all of that information, without having to go find it in the individual source files.

The source documents now simply become how you create custom AI agents that can answer employees questions through a lens forged by the context you provide.

What’s more, you can create unlimited collections, with unlimited AI assistants.

Already have an onboarding flow? Upload those documents into an Employee Onboarding Collection. Then, designate that collection as required learning for your team.

# Insights and Application

Because every collection is enabled with an agent, it makes on-demand, just-in-time insight extraction for very specific purposes.

**Example: Sales**

Have a sales team with a host of documents on process, pricing, product, positioning, sales decks, and other sales enablement material? Load it into a Sales Enablement repository.

Now your sales rep can simply ask “what’s the process for this”, or “what’s our policy on this”, or can you give me a quick summary of how this feature works.

Even better, because we use frontier models to power our agents, a sales rep can ask “I’m talking to John about this feature. This is my third call and I want to send him some follow-up information. Here’s his LinkedIn profile URL. Please look at it and use this as a foundation to identify what he’s likely to value, then compose an email I can send to him on this feature. Speak in his language and emphasize value you think he’s likely to appreciate given his profile”.

The agent can then create on-demand, just-in-time help for that very specific and very practical use case.

**Example: Product**

Do you have a product team that’s overflowing with product requirement documents, feature specs, documentation, user feedback, pricing analysis, and so much more?

Stop relying on the old-school way of doing things, which is that every product person has to manually read, understand, and synthesize it all, then hope they can produce the right insights from it. 

Instead, create a Product Collection.

Just dump all of that critical context into the collection, and now your product people can talk to an AI agent fully trained on every word. Now your product team has the fast-path to make fully informed, accurate decisions at speed. Now they can extract insights across a whole span of previously separate documents and domains.

Do you have a finance department riddled with spreadsheets, making it difficult to find the right information in the moment of need? Simply create a Finance Collection and dump it all in. Now the answers, analysis, and insights are just a question away. 

Every team and department in your organization has a similarly compelling use case. Now every team has access to the information and insights they need, in the moment of need, greatly improving individual and organizational velocity.

This is 21st Century knowledge management.

# Platform Self-Optimization

Having a platform rich with pre-built, expert-led courses, richly augmented with AI is one thing, especially when you can ask it any question and have it draw on that knowledge as it answers.

Being able to add to that rich and robust knowledge base all of your organizations content and context so that every answer is now imbued with that added insight and understanding is another.

But we don’t stop there.

Not only do we make it easy to train the platform on what matters most for the organization, or a specific team, we’ve actually trained our agents to pay attention, to learn from the conversations you have with it.

That means the platform becomes smarter, and more helpful over time.

Each time the AI identifies something important, that might be helpful for a future conversation, it recognizes it as insight. At the end of each interaction, if any insights are generated, it will list them in the conversation window. You can then click on those you want it to remember, and those insights are automatically stored in the platform. You can even make that process automatic, so it doesn’t have to ask each time.

Furthermore, that insight repository is simply an additional collection. We call it “Personal Insights”. That means you can go to that collection at any time to modify what it knows to be important, or to manually add insights that you want it to know about you.

The bottom line is that the more you, your teams, and your organization use the platform, the smarter it gets, the more helpful and tailored the replies are, and the faster your people can move.

It’s all about increasing human velocity by enhancing your team with the most powerful knowledge platform available.
