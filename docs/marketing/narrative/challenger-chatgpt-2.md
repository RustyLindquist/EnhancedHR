# Sales Deck - ChatGPT 2.0

## Slide 1 — The headline

**Decision velocity is the new competitive moat.**

AI is everywhere. The scarce advantage is: *who can make better decisions faster — at scale.*

(Anchor the macro climate with Microsoft’s “Frontier Firm / capacity strain” framing.)

**Talk track (20s):**

“AI isn’t the advantage. It’s the speed limit increase. The advantage is which organizations can convert information into decisions faster — consistently.”

---

## Slide 2 — The reframe: The Context Gap

**Your company doesn’t have a knowledge problem. You have a context problem.**

Knowledge exists — but not as **decision-grade context in the moment of need.**

**Visual:** “Knowledge exists → Context missing → Decisions slow / inconsistent”

---

## Slide 3 — Rational drowning: what it’s costing

**The average org is paying a hidden tax in search + rework.**

- Atlassian: leaders & teams waste **~25%** of time searching for answers.
- Two-thirds of knowledge workers say silos spread info across too many tools.

**Talk track (30–40s):**

“This isn’t just inefficiency — it’s inconsistent execution, slow onboarding, duplicated work, and avoidable risk.”

---

## Slide 4 — Emotional impact: what this feels like inside

**It shows up as:**

- Slow ramp for new hires
- Managers answering the same questions
- Policies misunderstood / inconsistently applied
- Teams reinventing work because they can’t find “the last right version”

**Visual:** 4 icons + one sentence each.

---

## Slide 5 — The mistake: what most AI strategies get wrong

**Most companies are adding intelligence… without fixing the workflow.**

McKinsey finds AI value is uneven; impact requires workflow redesign and operating model changes.

**Talk track:**

“Without a context layer, AI just accelerates output variance.”

---

## Slide 6 — A new way: AI-native knowledge operations

**Stop treating knowledge like files. Treat it like living context.**

A modern system needs:

1. **Tiered context repositories** (personal / team / org)
2. **Assigned learning paths** (onboarding, role readiness, leadership)
3. **Application-first learning** (tutor + assistant)
4. **Insight capture loop** (answers become reusable assets)

**Visual:** The four-part system.

---

## Slide 7 — The platform: Collections as custom context repositories

**Collections turn scattered content into a queryable context engine.**

Your site describes **Collection Portals** to organize content into Favorites, Research, and Custom Collections.

**Positioning line:**

“Collections are reusable ‘context repositories’ for teams and the org.”

**Talk track:**

“Instead of ‘go find the doc,’ employees ask the repository — and get answers grounded in what you approved.”

---

## Slide 8 — Company content → structured learning (the transfer engine)

**Institutional knowledge becomes teachable — fast.**

(Use your stated features here: upload videos/docs, create company courses, assign learning.)

**Proof-y supporting point:**

Your platform can auto-generate quizzes, summaries, and AI tutor interactions from video content.

**Talk track:**

“You don’t just store knowledge — you convert it into learning and readiness.”

---

## Slide 9 — Application-first learning (this is the differentiator)

**Learning isn’t watching. Learning is applying.**

EnhancedHR includes:

- **Course Assistant** (“instant librarian”)
- **Course Tutor** (role- and context-aware coaching)

**Optional credibility flex (if audience cares):**

You track every second of playback to make credits audit-proof — meaning you take measurement seriously.

---

## Slide 10 — Why not Copilot / Search / Wiki?

**Because retrieval and generation aren’t the system.**

- **Wikis** store content
- **Search** retrieves documents
- **Copilots** generate text
- **EnhancedHR operationalizes context:** repositories + learning + application + insight capture

**Visual:** 2×2 matrix: Storage / Retrieval / Generation / Operational Context

**Talk track:**

“We’re not competing with your tools. We reduce the cost of using them — by making the right context instantly accessible and reusable.”

---

## Slide 11 — Trust & governance (the slide that removes fear)

**To move fast, answers must be trustworthy.**

Your governance posture (say only what’s true today):

- Approved sources live in collections/courses
- Tiered repositories prevent context sprawl
- Clear ownership: who publishes, reviews, updates
- (If true) grounded answers with source references

**Talk track:**

“Speed without trust is risk. The goal is fast *and* aligned.”

---

## Slide 12 — Pilot: prove velocity in 14 days

**Pilot charter (forwardable):**

- **Teams:** pick 2 (Sales + Product is perfect)
- **Repositories:** Org (policies), Team (enablement), Onboarding (ramp)
- **Inputs:** 20–50 artifacts + 2–3 videos per team
- **Assigned learning:** one onboarding path + one role path
- **Success metrics:**
    - time-to-answer ↓
    - repeat questions ↓
    - ramp confidence ↑
    - fewer “where is that?” pings

**Close line:**

“If we can’t show meaningful velocity gains in 14 days, you shouldn’t buy it.”

# The final 15-minute delivery script (tight timing)

- Slides 1–2: 1.5 min (reframe)
- Slides 3–4: 3 min (rational + emotional drowning)
- Slide 5: 1 min (AI strategy mistake)
- Slides 6–9: 6 min (new way + system + differentiation)
- Slides 10–11: 2.5 min (objections: “why not X” + trust)
- Slide 12: 1 min (pilot + ask)

---

# Demo choreography (matches the Challenger narrative)

1. Build a Team Collection in 60 seconds
2. Ask 3 “moment of need” questions (policy, process, summary)
3. Show how you turn a video/doc into structured learning assets
4. Show tutor/assistant experience
5. Show insight capture loop (save the best answer back into a repository)

---

# Objection handling cheat sheet (the 5 you’ll hear most)

1. **“We already have Notion/Confluence.”**
    
    “Perfect — EnhancedHR isn’t a wiki replacement. It’s the context operations layer that makes your knowledge usable instantly and consistently.”
    
2. **“Why not Copilot/ChatGPT Enterprise?”**
    
    “Because AI without curated, tiered context creates variance. We turn approved content into decision-grade context and learning — then capture insights back into the system.”
    
3. **“Hallucinations scare us.”**
    
    “That’s why the system is built around approved sources, ownership, and trust posture — speed with alignment.”
    
4. **“Who maintains this?”**
    
    “We start small: 2 teams, 3 repositories, clear owners. The pilot proves value before broad rollout.”
    
5. **“This sounds like IT.”**
    
    “IT partners for security — but HR owns capability: onboarding, readiness, leadership development, and consistent policy understanding.”

If you want to push this into “unstoppable,” the next refinement is adding **one vivid story slide** (30 seconds) like:

> “A new PM asks: ‘What’s our pricing policy exception process?’
> 
> 
> Today: Slack + wrong doc + 3 people + 2 hours.
> 
> With EnhancedHR: ask once, get approved context instantly, move forward.”
> 

Give me one real internal example from *any* company (anonymized), and I’ll write 3 story variants that land like a hammer.
