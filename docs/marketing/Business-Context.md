# Business Context

# Primary Objective

An AI-enhanced learning platform that enables HR professionals to acquire knowledge, learn critical skills and easily earn and track recertification credits for SHRM and HRCI certifications.

The core of this experience are online courses, built by expert authors we have recruited. We want to provide a simple course experience (with the basic online learning features).

We want to further enrich those courses with AI assistants who can provide added value by converting standard course content into an interactive, highly tailored experience, and by providing an alternative learning experience for those who don’t just want to sit and watch a video.

# Overview

We are building an online academy called EnhancedHR.ai.

The primary audience are HR professionals, and the secondary audience is for leaders and managers.

The Basic objectives of the platform are:

- Provide a growing inventory of high-quality courses, authored by experts and delivered in a traditional online learning interface.
- Enrich the course experience with an AI Course Assistant, trained on the content of the course, providing the learner with a conversational interface to ask questions, learn course material, and apply that knowledge to their jobs.
- Enrich the course experience with an AI Tutor, trained on the course materials, who tutors the learner for a more individualized, AI-driven learning experience.
- Simplify their recertification process by making it easy to find certification-qualifying courses, take those courses, and access their recertification credits (SHRM professional development credits and HRCI recertification credits).
- Provide individual-level purchasing and access.
- Provide organizational-level purchasing, with the ability to grant employee access, billed on a per-employee-per-month basis.
- Allow organizations to easily track usage and see the ROI on their investment.

## The Problem

HR and leaders today need high-quality help with the most complex, tumultuous, and rapidly changing surface area of the organization... their people. Human Resources have always represented the most important, and most complex aspect of an organization, and is usually an organization’s single largest expense (often by a lot).

The pressure on leaders and HR to optimize their people has only grown in complexity over time, and recently, with the advent of AI, the problem has reached a critical point.

There is much fear over how the advent of AI will transform the organization, displace the traditional workforce, reduce or eliminate the need for many roles through automation, and radically change the roles that exist as they learn to use AI for work augmentation.

The radical change that AI will have upon the workforce and workplace is likely to be the most dramatic of any other change in the history of the workplace, if not the world.

The people on the front lines of solving this problem, are HR and organizational leadership.

To navigate this treacherous and ever-changing terrain, they need help.

## Our Core Belief

The idea is that humans are still relevant to the success of an organization, but the landscape of relevance has changed, is changing, and will continue to change. The primary role of HR and leaders today are to help themselves, their organizations, and the people within their organizations navigate this change.

Our foundational belief is that individuals who are adequately educated, aligned and empowered can achieve anything. We believe that this is the role of an organization and its leaders, and the extent to which they succeed at this, is the extent to which they will succeed at everything.

We also believe this is the role of AI, to augment an individual’s core capabilities and to help them identify, access and unleash their own full potential.

We believe that in the age of AI, “HR” is not about Human Resources, but Human Relevance. We believe that while any organization can increase efficiency through AI automation, the key to sustainable market differentiation is successfully augmenting the most relevant aspects of our people with the unbelievable power of AI.

Simply replacing humans with automation for the sake of efficiency and margins will only lead to short-term gains. But because every organization can do the same thing, this won’t ultimately lead to sustainable competitive advantage through real market differentiation.

We want to build a platform dedicated to this purpose.

## The Solution (Overview)

We want to build an online resource that helps HR and leaders learn how to understand what is happening, what it means, how to adapt, and what to do so that they themselves remain relevant, and how their people remain relevant, by sustaining and increasing their performance and productivity through AI augmentation and utilization.

Because of our core beliefs (humans + AI = maximum value), we want to champion a more advanced, evolved, and educated perspective, one of AI augmentation over human replacement. We want to build thought leadership around this, and be a strong voice in the market, leveraging this thought leadership both to influence this evolution, and also to garner brand awareness and expose people to our offering.

We anticipate HR, forever the champion of the people, will respond favorably to the sentiment we will champion. We believe also that they will value and appreciate our ability to arm them with language, ideas, and the intellectual arguments that can hold up in a board room. We believe that through the production of this thought leadership they will be naturally drawn to us, will organically share the material we produce, and will lean on us to best equip themselves to articulate human relevance within their organization.

The platform, sold to both individuals (HR professionals, leaders, and entrepreneurs) as well as organizations through HR, is a learning platform at it’s core, with courses being the fundamental content component.

In addition to using the thought leadership we develop around “human relevance” as marketing material, we want to build courses and curriculum, a full learning path, rich with tools, materials, ebooks, graphics, charts, data, and other resources, available in the platform as a core learning path within the platform.

The platform will host courses, content and curriculum from multiple external authors and content creators. We want to be the Pluralsight for HR.

The content and courses we inventory will be all about helping leaders and HR more effectively do their jobs. It will contain educational topics like leadership development, communication, and also more traditional and tactical courses designed for day-to-day people management and running a successful HR department.

The majority of the courses we provide will offer SHRM and HRCI recertification credits or professional development credits.

This is a huge, practical value to HR professionals, as they are constantly searching for ways to receive these credits so that they can maintain their certifications.

Traditional competitors for these credits, and HR learning in general, tend to occupy to main categories.

There are the platform-first providers. These are platforms that host and sell general content spanning multiple categories, like Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, EdX, Pluralsight, and even LinkedIn. These are typically relatively low-quality courses delivered through a traditional online learning user experience.

Then you have the industry-first competitors. These are certifying organizations like SHRM and HRCI who offer courses and content. These also tend to be a bit stale, old-school, and outdated (traditional) online delivery.

While we want to offer a traditional online learning experience, because it’s often required for recertification credits (the ability to track and show that they watched at least 45 minutes of content), we want to leverage AI to radically transform the user experience of course consumption.

Part of this will be that next to every course will have two AI companions.

### The AI Course Assistant

The first AI companion is a course assistant, which uses RAG to load the course into context, and is trained as in interactive assistant, allowing the user a conversational interface to engage with the course content. For instance, to ask for a summary, or highlights, or to see what it says about a particular topic, or to recall where in the video they talk about a certain thing, so they can jump right there.

### The AI Course Tutor

The second AI helper is a course tutor. This agent immediately engages the user in socratic dialog, asking key questions to ascertain things like that users level of knowledge, their specific roles and responsibilities, how much experience they have, or even information about their company, culture and market. The tutor will then take that knowledge and accessing the same repository as the Course Assistant, construct a completely custom path through the content, totally tailored to the individual for a fully personalized learning experience.

What’s more, all of that context extracted about the user will be saved and stored in a user profile, so that it’s accessible by the AI when the user access a Course Assistant or Course Tutor in other courses, reducing the need for repetition.

### Platform-Level AI Assistant

One of the primary features of the platform will be that you don’t have to think in terms of courses at all. You can simply ask the main agent, readily available from the user dashboard and throughout the platform. This Platform Assistant will act as a combo of curriculum assistant and personal tutor for all content across the platform. 

That main agent will then provide just-in-time knowledge and answers, drawing from the repository of courses and content across the platform, as well as the AI model’s core training data, to provide helpful assistance. 

Part of that will be the ability for the individual to ask the main agent to create an entirely custom training regimen, or act as a tutor to help them learn any topic. 

That main agent will draw on the content across the inventory (all accessible via RAG) as well as the context it has already gathered about the user as stored in the user profile (asking additional questions as necessary), and then putting together a whole custom experience, unique to that specific user and their specific situation.

This could be a collection of videos, or an entirely interactive, conversational path, or a mixture of course materials dripped and delivered within the conversation thread as it progresses.

### Author Compensation

Similar to Pluralsight, we will compensate our authors based on time users spend in a course. But since we are also providing the user with a non-traditional way of accessing and interacting with course content through AI, we need the platform to track whenever a content provider’s material is used in generating content, and they would be paid based on that usage. This serves multiple purposes. First, it allows content creators an easy way to simply dump everything they have into the platform, allowing us to rapidly leverage existing content. Second, they have an incentive to do so, knowing they can get future pay for past work. And third, it allows for rapid inventory expansion and higher-quality AI-generated responses.

### Competitors

To my knowledge, nobody else is doing this right now, and this kind of rich, AI-driven innovation on the platform side will create a rich, novel, and differentiating end-user experience, and an easy way for thought leaders to get paid for high-quality content. The model encourages and incentivizes authors to create courses (content) that is in high-demand and has high utility value.

The nearest competitor to this, at least to my knowledge, is Galileo Learn by the Josh Bersin Company. Their advantage is that they have a high-value, high-reach brand, and they’re really well known in the industry. That said, they traditionally tailor their offerings (and pricing) to a more enterprise customer base.

Our target audience is more of the little-guy, an early SMB market (e.g. 100-2,000 employees), and the platform will be priced to target this segment. Additionally, Bersin’s content usually comes across as highly academic, theoretical, somewhat high-brow, and a bit “out of touch” for the traditional earlier-stage organization.

Still, their platform features are on an innovation trajectory that coincides with ours, including a similar “platform-level AI assistant” to answer questions and to deliver what they call in-the-flow-of-work knowledge and help.
