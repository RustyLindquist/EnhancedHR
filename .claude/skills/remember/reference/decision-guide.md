# When to Use /remember vs Other Skills

## /remember vs /compact

| Symptom | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Forgetting instructions | /remember |
| Forgetting tools | /remember |
| Not delegating | /remember |
| Responses getting short | /context-status → maybe /compact |
| Missing earlier details | /context-status → maybe /compact |
| Context nearly full | /compact |

**Key insight**: /remember refreshes instructions, /compact frees capacity.

## /remember vs /context-status

- Run /context-status first if unsure about degradation type
- If context-status shows instruction degradation → /remember
- If context-status shows capacity issues → /compact

## Integration with Other Skills

### With /checkpoint
After /remember, good time to /checkpoint if instructions needed refreshing.

### With /session-start
Session-start includes a remember-equivalent refresh automatically.

### With /handoff
Before /handoff, run /remember to ensure accurate session summary.

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't skip /remember when noticing degradation (catch it early)
- Don't rely on /remember for capacity issues (use /compact)
- Don't ignore the behavioral check (verify behaviors are active)
